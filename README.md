# Mental Hell
This is the prototype of a 2D sidecroller horror game set in an abandoned sanitarium.

*Note: Mental Hell is still under developement and the full release ist still TBA!*

## Synopsis
You are an explorer trapped in the sanitarium. In order to get out again, you need to find the hearts of each lost soul (past patients) and return them to their ghosts.
But be careful not to loose your sanity, something is out there to get you. Explore many individual rooms and areas in which you can find the lost hearts. But keep in mind,
that each of the three hearts is at a random room each round and can only be found in the Past-World. So keep switching between the present and the past to find hidden secrets 
and lore. If you are successful and bring the three hearts back, you win the game!
