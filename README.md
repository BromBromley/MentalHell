# Mental Hell
This is the prototype of a 2D sidecroller horror game set in an abandoned asylum.

You are an explorer trapped in the asylum. In order to get out again, you need to find the hearts of past patients and return them to their ghosts.
But be careful not to loose your sanity, something is out there to get you.
